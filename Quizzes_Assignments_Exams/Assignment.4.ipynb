    "For this problem, we ask you to consider the single pendulum and double pendulums with friction, from *Dynamic.plots.1.ipynb* and *Dynamic.plots.2.ipynb*.   \n",
    "\n",
    "(a) In *Dynamic.plots.1.ipynb* the single pendulum differential equation had the two system constants, $a \\geq 0$ is what we called the *friction constant*, and $b > 0$ is the *mass/gravity constant*.  The differential equation had the form $\\theta'' + a \\theta' + b \\sin \\theta = 0$.   The *total energy* of the system is\n",

    "$$E_{tot} = (\\theta')^2 + 2b -2b\\cos\\theta$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For the simulation to be accurate, the total energy of the system should dissipate according to the heat loss through friction. Thus we should have equality\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dE}{dt} = -2a(\\theta')^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We call the right hand side of this equation the *theoretical power loss of the system*. If $E(t_i)$ represents the actual total energy of the system at time $t_i$, then the *actual power loss between frames* $t_i$ and $t_{i+1}$ would be the quantity $\\frac{E(t_{i+1})-E(t_i)}{t_{i+1} - t_i} = \\frac{\\Delta E}{\\Delta t}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the system with $a=0.1$, $b=1$, $\\theta_0 = 0$ and $\\theta'_0=10$, create a plot with one slider controlling the time step.  In your plot, show $\\theta(t)$ as a function of time. In a text field (in the plot) present the maximum (absolute value) of the difference between the theoretical $-2a(\\theta')^2$ power and the actual power loss $\\frac{\\Delta E}{\\Delta t}$ between frames of the animation.  Call this quantity the power-loss-deviation (PLD) of the simulation, i.e. in your plot you should have a text field \"MAX PLD: number\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure your time interval is long enough so that one can see the pendulum coming to rest (let's define this to be $E_{tot}(t_i) < 0.1$) for $t_i$ at the end of your interval.  \n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Determine the how small $\\Delta t$ needs to be to ensure the maximum PLD is less than *1.0*.\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) A properly simulated solution to this differential equation has a horizontal asymptote an integer multiple of $2\\pi$.  How small does $\\Delta t$ need to be to discover the correct asymptote, and what is the asymptote?\n"
