    "## Lab -- March 29th 30th\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab is based off the *Dynamic.plots.1/2/3.ipynb* notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part (1). Create an animated plot of the double pendulum with a *trace* like in the last plot from Dynamic.plots.1.ipynb.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part (2). Create a text field in your animated plot that gives a readout of the total energy of the system, i.e. the sum of the kinetic plus potential energies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part (3). Experiment with frictionless double pendulums.  In such a system, the total energy should be constant.  Is it constant in your simulation?  If not, experiment with ways of reducing the change in energy.  Some suggestions:\n",
    "\n",
    " (a) Try reducing your step size.\n",
    "\n",
    " (b) Try using a different numerical ODE integrator.\n",
    " \n",
    " (c) Perhaps consider adapting your ODE integrator technique to ensure the energy remains constant?\n",
    " \n",
    " (d) Can you think of anything else to try?\n",
